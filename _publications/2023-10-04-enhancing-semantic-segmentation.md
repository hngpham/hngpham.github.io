This paper presents a novel framework called **Reinforced Active Learning (RAL)** to enhance semantic segmentation performance under limited annotation resources and class imbalance.

### Key Contributions

- **Reinforcement Learning-Based Sample Selection**  
  RAL employs a reinforcement learning agent to identify the most informative and diverse samples for annotation. The reward function is designed to improve segmentation performance while addressing class imbalance.

- **Class Imbalance-Aware Sampling Strategy**  
  Introduces a metric that accounts for class distribution, encouraging the selection of samples that include rare or underrepresented classes. This leads to better performance across all categories.

- **Annotation Efficiency**  
  RAL achieves high segmentation accuracy with fewer labeled samples, reducing the cost and time associated with manual annotation.

- **Experimental Validation**  
  The framework was tested on datasets like **Cityscapes** and **ACDC**, where it outperformed conventional active learning methods in both efficiency and accuracy.

### Conclusion

RAL effectively balances the need for performance and annotation efficiency, particularly in imbalanced datasets, making it a strong candidate for practical semantic segmentation applications.
