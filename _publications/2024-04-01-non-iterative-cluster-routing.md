This paper introduces a non-iterative cluster routing technique tailored for capsule networks, aiming to overcome the limitations of traditional iterative routing methods like dynamic routing or EM routing. 

The proposed method:
- Preserves the part–whole relationship fundamental to capsule networks.
- Eliminates the need for repeated iterations, reducing computational complexity.
- Demonstrates better generalization to novel viewpoints and poses in vision tasks.
- Achieves competitive or superior performance on datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR-10, while using fewer parameters.

The authors provide both theoretical analysis and practical implementation strategies, validating the approach through empirical experiments and architectural comparisons.
