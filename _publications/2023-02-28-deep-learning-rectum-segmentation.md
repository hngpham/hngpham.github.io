title: "Deep Learning-Based Rectum Segmentation on Low-field Prostate MRI to Assist Image-guided Biopsy"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/2023-02-28-deep-learning-rectum-segmentation
excerpt: "This study presents a deep learning approach for automatic rectum segmentation in low-field (58â€“74 mT) prostate MRI scans. Utilizing a U-Net architecture, the model achieved a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.89, demonstrating its potential to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of image-guided prostate biopsies in low-resource settings."
