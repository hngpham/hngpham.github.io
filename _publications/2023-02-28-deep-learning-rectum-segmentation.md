excerpt: "This study presents a deep learning approach for automatic rectum segmentation in low-field (58â€“74 mT) prostate MRI scans. Utilizing a U-Net architecture, the model achieved a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.89, demonstrating its potential to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of image-guided prostate biopsies in low-resource settings."

This study evaluates whether radiomics features from CT scans can predict 5-year survival in gastric cancer patients.

- **Data**: 406 patient CT scans; 168 survived, 238 did not.
- **Approach**: Tumor segmentation followed by extraction of 103 radiomics features using PyRadiomics.
- **Two Methods**:
  - **2D**: Features from a single CT slice.
  - **Quasi-3D**: Weighted average features from multiple slices.
- **Feature Reduction**: PCA reduced features to 11 (2D) and 7 (3D).
- **Models Tested**: Logistic Regression (LRM), ANN, and SVM.
- **Best Performance**: LRM with quasi-3D features (AUC = 0.72), but not significantly better than 2D (AUC = 0.70, p = 0.21).
