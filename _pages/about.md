Welcome! I'm **Huong Pham**, a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Oklahoma. My research spans medical imaging, computer vision, and large language models (LLMs), with a focus on developing **novel deep learning architectures** and **robust evaluation frameworks**â€”particularly for biomedical and environmental applications.

As both an engineer and researcher, Iâ€™m passionate about:

- Creating deep learning models that solve real-world problems  
- Building AI-powered productivity tools that make life more efficient  
- Translating research into systems that work beyond the lab  

One of my personal projects is [**Focuses**](https://www.focuses.us)â€”an AI-driven news assistant built on the FreshRSS platform. Itâ€™s designed for people who want to stay informed without falling into the trap of endless scrolling. No ads, no clutterâ€”just meaningful content curated to save you time and help you stay focused.  
ðŸ‘‰ [Check out the demonstration here](https://www.focuses.us).

Outside of research, I enjoy building smart home workflows using Home Assistant, ESP32s, and REST APIsâ€”**automating around the house** to make daily life smoother and more efficient. I also enjoy playing badminton and hiking whenever I get the chance.

I'm currently seeking opportunities that combine **innovative model design** with **practical impact**, especially in **vision-language modeling**, **AI for healthcare**, and **intelligent automation**.

**Letâ€™s connect** if you're looking for someone with strong technical depth, practical engineering experience, and a commitment to building impactful AI applications.
