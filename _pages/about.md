Welcome! I'm **Huong Pham**, a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Oklahoma, where I conduct research at the intersection of medical imaging, computer vision, and large language models. My work focuses on designing advanced segmentation algorithms, retrieval-augmented generation systems, and foundational model evaluation frameworks—particularly in biomedical and environmental applications.

As an engineer and researcher, I’m passionate about:
- Scaling deep learning for multi-modal data (images, text, and video),
- Building productivity tools powered by LLMs,
- Translating research into real-world automation and assistive systems.
One of the product I built is published at www.focuses.us. A news assistants that is built on FreshRSS open-source platform. It can help to extract important information for you so that can save you tons of time.
Beyond my technical work, I have hobbies in automation, design integrated workflows using Home Assistant, ESP32s, and REST APIs to streamline daily routines—including smart parenting tools and real-time environmental monitors.
I am also enjoying play badminton and hiking.

I'm actively seeking opportunities that bridge cutting-edge research and practical deployment in areas like **vision-language modeling**, **AI for healthcare**, and **intelligent automation**.
